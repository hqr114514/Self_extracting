需要安装g++和make ( windows需要将它们添加到PATH )
打开程序后输入操作系统类型( windows 或 linux )
接着输入若干个文件名, 表示要添加的文件列表, windows输入ctrl+z结束
linux需要以参数启动, 参数为一个文件名即文件列表(windows也可以)
文件列表与程序的正常输入格式一致

g++ and make need to be installed (windows needs to add them to the PATH)
Open the program and enter the operating system type (Windows or Linux)
Then enter a number of file names to indicate the list of files to be added, and end with Ctrl+Z in Windows
Linux needs to be started with a file name, which is a file list (Windows can also be used)
The list of files is consistent with the program's normal input format
